  <p>I am like the ocean. I have empathy and I am nurturing. I have a diffused awareness, thinking many things at once and I find details and intricacies that are beautiful. I am born to receive and be directed.  </p>
  <button onclick="female()" class="button">Yes</button>
      <button onclick="urresult1()" value="You lack feminine charm: You have a rigid and linear energy which is identifies as masculine.Being a woman is all about bringing a special spark and a sense of mystery with you wherever you go! Remember that, as a woman, your feminine energy is always there, even if you can’t feel it. It just needs to be reawakened. It’s an energy that will make you intuitive, compassionate, creative, sensitive, receptive, tender, kind, radiant, nurturing, and – most importantly – unstoppable!" class="feminist button">No</button>

        <div class="q">
  <p>I have a life direction and purpose and can achieve anything I put my mind to it. My life is controlled by what i focus on. I set my goals high and don't stop until I get there. I don't decrease the goal, I increase the effort. I don't like dwelling on feeling and emotions. I transend emotions into awareness.</p>
  <button onclick="male()" value="You are too ambitious:  Its great that you have a strong purpose and direction. But you need to reduce your linear and rigid spirit. Rigidness in individuals can indicate depression and anxiety. People who are controlling and inflexible often find themselves frustrated because the rest of the world doesn't live by their rules and expectations. You need to develop flexibility. Flexibility means seeing things from different perspectives, tolerating ambiguity, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. It helps us adapt to a constantly changing environment and shows that we can handle diversity and accept other people's preferences. Flexibility leads to openness, more opportunities, and less depression and anxiety." class="button">Yes</button>

  <button onclick="male()" value="You are ashamed to be a woman: You need to accept your feminine energy. There is nothing wrong with compliments. Any time you receive a compliment, reply with 'Thank you.' It’s a simple, but powerful phrase. The person bestowing the compliment will be most receptive to a humble response. Say something like, 'Thank you, that’s very kind of you,' or 'Thank you, I appreciate the compliment.'" class="feminist button" >No</button>

(Matthew 16:26). At the end of the day, careers are an empty and thankless pursuit: Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.

  <button onclick="female()" class="button">Yes</button>
  <button onclick="male()" value="You envy men: While the masculine is defined by logic, the feminine is expressed through emotions. We all have emotional selves, but many of us haven't been taught how to understand our feelings. You need to become aware of and regulate your own emotions while also empathetically being aware of the emotions and reactions of those around you. As you become more and more emotionally intelligent, you're enabled to govern your relationship with yourself and others more efficaciously, even in the face of conflict.
